    <h3> What are the external style sheets?</h3>
            - With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file. <br>
            - Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.
    
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
