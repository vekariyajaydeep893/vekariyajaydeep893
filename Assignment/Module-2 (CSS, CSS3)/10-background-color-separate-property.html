Why should background and color be used as separate properties?

    There are two reasons behind this
    - It enhances the legibility of style sheets. /the background property is a complex property in CSS, and if it is combined with color, the complexity will further increase.
    - Color is an inherited property while the background is not. So this can make confusion further.
