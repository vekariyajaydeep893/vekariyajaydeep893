    <h1> What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?</h1>

    The advantages of External Style Sheets are:

    - Using them, the styles of multiple documents can be controlled from one file.
    - Classes can be created for use on multiple HTML element types in many documents.
    - In complex situations, selector and grouping methods can be used to apply styles.
    
    The disadvantages of External Style Sheets are:
    
    - In order to import style information for each document, an extra download is needed.
    - Until the external style sheet is loaded, it may not be possible to render the document.
    - For small number of style definitions, it is not viable.
